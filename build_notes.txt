Oathgen is written in C++11. In order to build oathgen, you must use a C++11 
compiler. See the 'build.sh' script for the exact compiler options. Oathgen has 
been built on g++, clang++ and MSVC++ compilers, but other C++11 compilers may 
work too.

Oathgen uses the Crypto++ library for hexadecimal and base32 decoding and 
HMAC-SHA1 and SHA2.
